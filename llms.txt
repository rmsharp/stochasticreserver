# stochasticreserver

## Introduction

Maximum likelihood estimators provide a powerful statistical tool. In
this paper we directly deal with non-linear reserving models, without
the need to transform those models to make them tractable for linear or
generalized linear methods. We also show how the same general approach
can be easily adapted to provide estimates for a very wide range of
reserving methods and models, making use of the same framework, and even
much of the same computer code. We focus on the triangle of incre-
mental average costs, and show how five common methods can be set in a
stochastic framework.

## Reserving Models

Five stochastic reserving model implementations

- [`berquist()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/berquist.md)
  : Create list for Berquist-Sherman incremental severity model
- [`capecod()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/capecod.md)
  : Create list for Kramer Chain Ladder parmaterization model g -
  Assumed loss emergence model, a function of the parameters a. Note g
  must be matrix-valued with size rows and size columns g itself Basic
  design is for g to be a function of a single parameter vector, however
  in the simulations it is necessary to work on a matrix of parameters,
  one row for each simulated parameter, so g_obj must be flexible enough
  to handle both. Here g_obj is nonlinear and based on the Kramer Chain
  Ladder parmaterization
- [`chain()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/chain.md)
  : Create list for Cape Cod model
- [`hoerl()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/hoerl.md)
  : Create list for Generalized Hoerl Curve Model with trend g itself
  Basic design is for g to be a function of a single parameter vector,
  however in the simulations it is necessary to work on a matrix of
  parameters, one row for each simulated parameter, so g_obj must be
  flexible enough to handle both. Here g_obj is Wright's operational
  time model with trend added
- [`wright()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/wright.md)
  : Create list for Generalized Hoerl Curve with individual accident
  year levels (Wright's)

## Optimization Functions

Maximum likelihood estimation framework

- [`make_negative_log_likelihood()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/make_negative_log_likelihood.md)
  : Make Negative Loglikelihood Function to be Minimized
- [`make_gradient_of_objective()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/make_gradient_of_objective.md)
  : Make Gradient of the objective function
- [`make_log_hessian()`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/make_log_hessian.md)
  : Make Hessian of the objective function

  development triangle used by Roger Hayne to illustrate the stochastic
  loss reserving software in

  A0 is a 10 x 10 matrix representing the upper triangle of a actuarial
  development triangle used by Roger Hayne to illustrate the stochastic
  loss reserving software in

- [`dnom`](https://rmsharp.github.io/stochasticreserver/reference/dnom.md)

  dnom is count forcast for the B0 development triangle; the exposures
  (claims) used in the denominator \#' @format integer vector of length
  10

  B0

  :   count forcast for the B0 development triangle.
