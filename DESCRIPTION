Description: Maximum likelihood estimators provide a powerful statistical tool.
    This package directly deals with non-linear reserving models, without the
    need to transform those models to make them tractable for linear or
    generalized linear methods. The same general approach can be easily adapted
    to provide estimates for a very wide range of reserving methods and models,
    making use of the same framework, and even much of the same computer code.
    The package focuses on the triangle of incremental average costs, and shows
    how five common methods can be set in a stochastic framework.
