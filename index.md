# stochasticreserver

## Introduction

Maximum likelihood estimators provide a powerful statistical tool. In
this paper we directly deal with non-linear reserving models, without
the need to transform those models to make them tractable for linear or
generalized linear methods. We also show how the same general approach
can be easily adapted to provide estimates for a very wide range of
reserving methods and models, making use of the same framework, and even
much of the same computer code. We focus on the triangle of incre-
mental average costs, and show how five common methods can be set in a
stochastic framework.
