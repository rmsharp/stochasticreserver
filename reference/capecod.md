## Usage

``` r
capecod(B0, paid_to_date, upper_triangle_mask)
```

## Arguments

- B0:

  development triangle

- paid_to_date:

  numeric vector of length `size`. It is the lower diagnal of the
  development triangle in row order. It represents the amount paid to
  date.

- upper_triangle_mask:

  is a mask matrix of allowable data, upper triangular assuming same
  development increments as exposure increments
